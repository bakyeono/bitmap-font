![Multi-lang bitmap font in Clojure/LWJGL][img-bitmap-font-demo]

This Clojure/LWJGL demo renders bitmap fonts in good old 1990s MS-DOS style.

Of course, there's nothing special in rendering bitmap fonts itself. But this demo supports [Hangul][wiki-hangul] bitmap fonts, whose printing system is somewhat difficult. It isn't such a no-brainer as bliting Latin Alphabet bitmap fonts, for, in Hangul, 2 ~ 3 parts('jamo's) combine into a full character.

I'm also planning to support other languages if I can get other bitmap fonts whose characters have height of 16 pixel.

## Usage

You can run the demo by typing this on command line:

~~~
lein run
